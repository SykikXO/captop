# Worker

Cloudflare Worker deployment files.

- **cloudflare_worker.js**: Proxy script to route requests between users and the backend server. (To bypass VITBPL's Fortinet restriction as my sykik.pythonanywhere.com is marked as unrated/unreviewed.)
- **wrangler.toml**: Configuration for Wrangler deployment. (Worker service deployment from terminal.)
